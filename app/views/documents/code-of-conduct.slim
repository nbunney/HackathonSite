h2 Code Of Conduct
p
  | By participating in any Valley Hackathon event, you agree to abide by the
    following code of conduct.
ul
  li
    | Treat all other hackers with utmost respect. Be kind to others. Do not
      insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that
      harassment and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate
      for this event. If at any point you see a fellow hacker being harassed,
      it’s your responsibility to talk to the nearest hackathon organizer.
  li
    | Treat our sponsors with the utmost respect. Without them, nothing would
      be possible. Take some time out of your work to go meet and speak with
      them. If they come over to talk to you, look up from your work and give
      them a bit of your time. They're here for you! Show them you appreciate it.
  li
    | Teams can be anywhere from one to four members. All teams retain full
      ownership of what they have created during the Valley Hackathon.
  li
    | The hackathon is a walled garden. To ensure a level playing field for all
      contestants, all code, design, art, music, SFX, and assets must be
      created during the duration of the hackathon. We want to ensure that all
      participants start off on the same footing and we also want to preserve
      the true nature of a hackathon. You are, however, free to make plans,
      create wireframes, and brainstorm prior to the event.
  li
    | The only exception to the previous rule would include material that is
      freely available to the public. Some examples of this would be: public
      domain images, Creative Commons music, open source libraries, existing
      APIs and platforms, and the like. Failure to comply may result in the
      offending team's disqualification.
h2 TL;DR
p
  | Bring your blueprints, build at the hackathon. It’s the only way we can
    compare hacks on a level playing field and fairly award prizes. It’s also
    what lets you say “I built this at a hackathon."
p
  | Have fun. Hackathons are amazing, and so are you. We’re so happy you’re
    able to hack with us and be a part of our amazing community.
p
  | Open your mind. Hacking unites people from across the world from different
    cultural norms, nationalities, and backgrounds. Be prepared not only to
    learn something new from your hack, but also from the amazing people around
    you. Be mindful of the fact that certain content and actions can make the
    people around you uncomfortable. If your hack contains material that might
    cross that boundary, talk to a member of the organizing team for a second
    or third opinion. We'll let you know if you should consider rethinking your
    hack.
p
  | Be the change you want to see in your local community. Never be afraid of
    competing based on where you come from or have preconceptions of grandeur
    because you come from a great school. At any time one can achieve
    greatness. You simply have to see it and seize it.
